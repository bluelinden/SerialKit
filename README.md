# SerialKit
SerialKit is a TypeScript game engine for novel-style games that supports extremely complex dialogue trees.

By simply creating markup files for each translation of your game, you can create novel-style games without a lot of technical effort.

## Complex dialogue tree support
SerialKit supports:
* direct dialogue tree descendants, nested however deep you'd like
* ID references to other dialogue items
* imports from other dialogue files
